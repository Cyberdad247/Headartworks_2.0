# Review System Performance Optimization

## Caching Strategy
- Implemented SWR (stale-while-revalidate) pattern for reviews
- LocalStorage cache with 5-minute TTL
- Cache key includes product ID for isolation
- Automatic revalidation when cache expires

## Lazy Loading
- Review listings load in paginated chunks (5 reviews per page)
- Media items lazy-loaded with intersection observer
- Review form loaded only when needed

## Bundle Optimization
- Review components code-split
- Yotpo SDK loaded asynchronously
- SVG stars optimized with inline rendering

## Network Optimization
- API calls debounced and batched
- Review images use Shopify CDN with size variants
- Video reviews use adaptive streaming

## Rendering Performance
- Virtualized review list for long content
- CSS containment for review items
- Will-change hints for animations

## Monitoring
- Review load times tracked in analytics
- Error rates monitored
- Cache hit ratio tracked
