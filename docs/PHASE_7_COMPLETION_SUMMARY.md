## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Language Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Multi-layered language detection
const detectionMethods = [
  { method: 'previous_session', confidence: 0.9 },
  { method: 'browser', confidence: 0.8 },
  { method: 'geolocation', confidence: 0.6 },
  { method: 'ip_detection', confidence: 0.5 }
];
```

### Regional Variant Configuration
```javascript
// Regional variant mapping
const REGIONAL_VARIANTS = {
  'en': ['en-US', 'en-GB', 'en-CA', 'en-AU'],
  'es': ['es-ES', 'es-MX', 'es-AR'],
  'fr': ['fr-FR', 'fr-CA'],
  'de': ['de-DE', 'de-AT', 'de-CH'],
  'zh': ['zh-CN', 'zh-TW']
};
```

### RTL Language Detection
```javascript
// RTL language identification
const RTL_LANGUAGES = ['ar', 'he', 'fa', 'ur'];
const isRTL = (language) => RTL_LANGUAGES.includes(language);
```
